          </p>
          <h3 class="text-md font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">The Power of Modern Web Technologies</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-white/70 mb-6">
            <li><strong>React & Next.js:</strong> Create lightning-fast, interactive user interfaces that deliver app-like experiences in the browser. Server-side rendering ensures excellent SEO and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Node.js & Express:</strong> Build scalable backend APIs that handle thousands of concurrent requests efficiently. JavaScript across the entire stack streamlines development.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> Deploy on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for automatic scaling, high availability, and global reach without managing physical servers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-white/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong>Real-world example:</strong> A retail company replaced their outdated website with a custom React application. The new platform loads in under 2 seconds, integrates with their inventory system in real-time, and has increased online conversions by 65%. The investment paid for itself within six months.

            With over 6 billion smartphone users worldwide, mobile apps offer unparalleled opportunities for customer engagement. The key is choosing the right development approach for your goals and budget.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-md font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Native vs. Cross-Platform: Making the Right Choice</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-white/70 mb-6">
            <li><strong>Native Development (Swift/Kotlin):</strong> Maximum performance and access to latest platform features. Ideal for apps requiring intensive graphics, complex animations, or deep OS integration.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Platform (React Native/Flutter):</strong> Single codebase runs on both iOS and Android, reducing development time by 40-60%. Perfect for business apps, social platforms, and content-driven experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Progressive Web Apps:</strong> Web applications that work offline and can be installed on home screens. Great for content sites and tools that need wide accessibility.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-white/70 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Start with cross-platform development to validate your concept quickly and cost-effectively. You can always build native versions later for specific features that require them.
